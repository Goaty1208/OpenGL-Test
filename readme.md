Yeah, that's right. That does what it says.

## Objectives
Eventually this crap will be able (maybe) to display a cube and I might even make it spin, or hell, even add a 3D camera.

Don't expect more.

## Licenses and whatnot
Still new to the whole licensing thing.
Essentially, you can do whatever you want to this crap, and you can use it as a base for your project... for some reason. Don't see why you would though.

## Compiling
Christ, I hate GCC.
I hate compiling.
I hate python.

Yet here we are, compiling the project with Python

There are two ways to compile this piece of crap:
1. Use the compiler.py file. 
2. Use the VSCode task provided. That's right, this stuff was made on VSCode and not VS. Yes, it was painful. Yes, it took a week to compile it correctly.
